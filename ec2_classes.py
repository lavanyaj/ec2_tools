# Why are these classes stored in a separate module from ec2.py?
#
# These classes are put in a separate module because ec2.py stores
# instances of these classes by pickling (through shelves).  Pickling
# classes defined within ec2.py creates namespace problems that can be
# solved by putting the class definitions into a separate module. See:
